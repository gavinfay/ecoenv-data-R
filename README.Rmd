## Course description

* Number of credits: 3

Practice in preparation, wrangling, exploration, summarizing, programming, and modeling of ecological and environmental data using the statistical software R. Introduction to data science using R to equip students with technical skills to rapidly analyze and visualize data commonly found in marine ecological and environmental science. The course emphasizes the use of R and supporting software to implement repeatable and reproducible scientific workflows. Active learning in computer lab exercises and tutorials will introduce students to a complete, big picture of the data science cycle and provide the basic tools to perform high quality data analysis. In addition to computer lab exercises, students will apply skills developed to datasets and problems from scientific, environmental, and policy organizations in the South Coast and New Bedford area, completing group projects on a data analysis problem relevant to their chosen organization and dataset. Students will meet with professionals at these institutions to understand data analysis needs and questions, and present results of their analyses to class and their institutional representatives, and prepare a report on their analyses.

## Objectives:
1.	Experience using R to solve data problems and improve scientific workflow
2.	Learn how to transform datasets into convenient forms for analysis
3.	Application of data exploration and visualization to effectively address data science questions
4.	Understand the role of modeling in summarizing data to discern signals from noise
5.	Communicate results of analyses through integrated reporting

## Pre-requisites: None

## Relationship of course to program context and effectiveness: 
This course provides students with technical skills in data analysis, and experience applying R to ecological and environmental datasets. By equipping students with computational skills to rapidly and repeatedly perform exploration, visualization, and modeling of data, students will be able to apply these skills to more advanced scientific material later in their degree programs, and provide the data literacy required of modern STEM professionals. By linking with professionals at agencies and organizations within the region, students will be exposed to the types of questions and problems faced in real-world applications in places that are locally important to them, and will improve quantitative communication skills. This course also provides students with data analytic skills that will serve well for future mathematics, statistics, and computational coursework.


The courses focuses on data acquisition and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and effective communication and approaching statistics from a model-based, instead of an inference-based, perspective. A heavy emphasis is placed on a consistent syntax (with tools from the `tidyverse`), reproducibility (with R Markdown) and version control and collaboration (with git/GitHub). We help ease the learning curve by avoiding local installation and supplementing out-of-class learning with interactive tools (like `learnr` tutorials). By the end of the semester teams of students work on fully reproducible data analysis projects on data they acquired, answering questions they care about.
